## üöÄ Features

This calculator includes a variety of numerical methods, categorized by their application:

### **Root-Finding & Equation Solving**

  * **Bisection Method:** A robust method for finding roots within a given interval.
  * **False Position Method:** An improvement over the bisection method that converges faster.
  * **Newton's Method:** An efficient, iterative method for finding roots using a function's derivative.
  * **Secant Method:** An alternative to Newton's method that does not require a derivative.
  * **Simple Fixed-Point Iteration:** Finds roots by rearranging the function into a fixed-point form.

### **Linear Algebra & Systems of Equations**

  * **Cramer's Rule:** A direct method for solving a system of linear equations using determinants.
  * **Gauss Method:** Solves linear systems through a systematic elimination process.
  * **Gauss-Jordan Method:** An extension of Gaussian elimination that reduces the matrix to a fully diagonal form.
  * **LU Decomposition:** Factorizes a matrix into a lower and upper triangular matrix to solve linear systems efficiently.

### **Optimization**

  * **Golden Section Method:** Finds the extremum of a unimodal function within an interval.
  * **Gradient Method:** An iterative optimization algorithm for finding the local minimum of a function.
